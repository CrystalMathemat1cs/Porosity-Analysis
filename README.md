# Porosity-Analysis
Using image processing techniques, the code in this Jupyter Notebook calculates the porosity of Yttria-Stabilised-Zirconia layers of thermal barrier coatings used in jet engine applications. The samples analysed in this notebook have all been deposited through Atmospheric Plasma Spray (APS).

Although the method requires some refinement and can only be considered semi-quantitative, it does a great job at determining the porosity, with values matching those in literature, as well as matching values acquired by applying the same principles in Photoshop or ImageJ, where the same process would be much more labour-intensive with increasing number of images.
